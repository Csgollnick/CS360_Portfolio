Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was designed to track events near and far into the future.  It allows the user to input and event and register an account as well as update those events later.  The 
end goal was to create an application for a user to put in any events in professional or personal circles to be able to organize themself much better.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs 
successful?

The mandatory screens initially were a login page and a viewing event page. Through development it was discovered more screens were needed. As such I added a separate 
screen for registering an account, updating an event, and registering an event. This I felt was a clearer separation for the user to be able to perform various functions
in the app. The success of which can be measured by how the design seems easier for a user to navigate.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When coding the app, I tried to keep my code clean and aligned properly, comment clearly, and order things in a semblance or reason and logic that would be easy to follow.
I think future projects can follow a similar format as it allows for cleaner reading and an easier manner in which to edit in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested most of it utilizing the AVD manager and referring to the logcat and build/run logs.  This allowed me to test individual functionality and look for errors to correct.
Once I had what seemed like a fully functional application, I installed it on multiple devices to run tests.  This allowed me to see more user based errors that could occur
from usage that logs would not catch.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Innovation to overcome came from utilization of the database.  As I came to the viewing an event screens, it was not a clear path as to how to present the information.
I created multiple methods in the events database class to get information individually so it could be set to the correct variables and places to present the data
to the user.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think my best work in this app may have been in the datbase work and creating and calling methods.  Most of it seemed well to me.  There are some UI elements I wish to go back 
and clean up as well as I don't feel I truly got the SMS notification aspect.
